vcflib
 a simple C++ library for parsing and manipulating VCF files.

author: Erik Garrison <erik.garrison@bc.edu>

The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual format
intended to concisely describe reference-indexed variations between
individuals.  The current specification can be found on the 1000 Genomes wiki
(http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/doku.php?id=1000_genomes:analysis:vcf4.0).

This library provides a simple API to map each VCF record into a C++ class.
See vcfstats.cpp for example usage.

Presently vcflib does not attempt to use tag information in the header to
determine the datatype of each field in the site info and sample records, but
this is planned for a subsequent revision.
